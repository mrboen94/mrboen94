![Mathias BÃ¸es github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mrboen94&show_icons=true&theme=synthwave)

My name is Mathias, take a look around and dont be afraid to ask any questions. 

I am a master student at UiB, my master is within the field of data/computer visualization. Apart from nerding out on the computer I like to take ye olde camera out for a spin and take photographs of the landscape around me. I am also getting into bouldering as a side hobby. 

Challenges are everything in life, but I am a firm believer than humanity would never have gotten to where it is if we weren't such a lazy species. Imagine the first person who got so tired of digging in the dirt that he invented the excavator? It's amazing the effort humans will go through just to make something easier. That is also where my passion in programming lies, it doesn't matter if it's hard as long as it makes life easier and/or better for someone.
